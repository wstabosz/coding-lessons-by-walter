# Answer
Development tools like an IDE (VS Code, etc) often come with debuggers. Modern web browsers usually have built in Javascript debugger.

A debugger is a program that helps you find bugs in your code. Imagine it as a play/pause button. Your program consists of lines of code, which are instructions for the computer to follow. The debugger lets you pause your code and see what's happening internally to your variables and logic blocks.

A break point is a line of code where you have asked the debugger to pause the program so that you can answer questions like, on the 5th iteration of my loop, what is the value of X ?

Single-stepping means you have paused your program, and ask the debugger to run the next line of code, but then pause again. I single-step when I want slow things down and evaluate the logic in my head. It helps me find mistakes when my head-computer expects one thing to happen, and the real-computer does something else. 

If I am trying to answer the question "why is my program going to the else block?". I would set a break point, and watch the value of the variables that dictate my if-else flow logic. As I single step through code, I may see a variable change when I was not expecting it to.

I didn't watch too much of these videos, but they look like they may be helpful to you. The 2nd one is a bit more advanced, it actually taught me some new things.
